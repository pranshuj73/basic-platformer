  <br />
  <b>Q. Why is the name 'basic-platformer'?</b>
  
  A: It isn't the best name for the game, I agree. But given that there's no story line and I couldn't think of what to call it, 
  I just decided to call it what it literally is, a 'basic-platformer' game

  <b>Q: What's the plot of the game?</b>
  
  A: So far, it's just hero killing monsters and reaching end of level to win. 
  If you come up with a better storyline for the game, please add it here!

  <b>Q: Why did you make the game open-source? / What do I gain by contributing?</b>
  
  A: I'm not too keen about game-dev but as it turns out making a game like this was a really good refresher for the OOP concepts in Python. 
  I decided to make this open-source because currently Hacktoberfest 2021 is going on, and I thought of being a maintainer this time!
  I hope by contributing, you get a little better understanding of how git, GitHub & open-source projects work. Not to mention, Python, OOP and Pygame too!
